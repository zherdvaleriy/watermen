                    <p class="card-text">
                      The region was once a chunk of land called the <em style="color: blue;">Arctic Continent</em> that broke into pieces and formed the <em style="color: blue;">Arctic Ocean</em>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                      The water body is unique because it is surrounded by land with only some narrow straits connecting it with neighbouring oceans. Its formation took <b>millions of years</b>, and it evolved due to the growth and retreat of ice sheets, sea level changes in the bygone ages, and variations in oceanic circulations.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <em style="color: blue;"> The Arctic Ocean</em>. is <b>Earth's</b> northernmost body of water. It encircles the Arctic, and flows beneath it. Most of <em style="color: blue;"> the Arctic Ocean</em> is covered by ice throughout the year—although that is starting to change as temperatures climb. Pale and stark on the surface, <em style="color: blue;"> the Arctic Ocean</em> is home to a stunning array of life.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                      Though it's the world's smallest ocean—spanning <b>6.1 million square miles</b> - <em style="color: blue;"> the Arctic </em> is now receiving unprecedented international attention. Scientists are racing to understand how warming temperatures will alter <em style="color: blue;">  Arctic Ocean</em> waters—and by extension the rest of the climate—and world leaders are racing to control newly opening waters.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <em style="color: blue;"> the Arctic Ocean</em> is warming faster than anywhere else on <b>Earth</b> and feeling the onslaught of climate change.</p>

                    <p class="card-text"> <em style="color: blue;">The U.S., Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and Russia</em> all have territories that reach into <em style="color: blue;"> the Arctic Ocean</em>. About <b>four million people</b> live in <em style="color: blue;"> the Arctic region</em>, many of them indigenous groups that have thrived there for millennia. To survive in the harsh climate, many of the region's people rely on the ocean's bounty to sustain their livelihoods. This includes fishing, sealing, whaling, and other activities.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <em style="color: blue;"> The Arctic's</em> otherworldly landscapes are also increasingly drawing tourists to the region.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      As once impenetrable sea ice becomes less stable, <em style="color: blue;">Nothern Hemisphere</em> countries have begun to take a greater interest in the <em style="color: blue;"> the Arctic</em> as a path for shipping lanes, military presence, and commercial opportunities, particularly oil and gas exploration.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <em style="color: blue;"> The Arctic Ocean</em> is mostly covered with ice. It does not have many ports because of the harsh weather conditions. The ports transport essential items to sparsely populated communities, handling research and extracting resources.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <b>Kirkines</b> port is a major port which connects <em style="color: blue;">Norway, Finland and Russia.</em> It is a deep water facility that is ice-free throughout the year, which makes it essential for shipping and fishing.

                    <p class="card-text">Much of <em style="color: blue;">the Arctic Ocean's</em> complex life can only be seen by underwater explorers who dive through holes in thick sea ice. Much of the ocean here is dark, blocked from sunlight by ice cover, but photographers have dived with lights to expose underwater <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em> life.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Scientists note that studying life in <em style="color: blue;">the Arctic Ocean</em> can be difficult because the region is hard to access. Much is still unknown about <em style="color: blue;">the Arctic's</em> marine food web.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <b>Plankton</b> —a group that consists of tiny organisms like algae and bacteria—make up the base of <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em> food chain. They convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into organic matter that in turn feeds everything from small fish to large bowhead whales. Growing inside the tunnels naturally carved into sea ice are plankton-eating zooplankton. Even farther below are bottom-dwelling organisms like <b>sea anemones, corals, and sponges</b>.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                        Many animals that are often seen roaming the sea ice are also adapted for the water. <b>Polar bears</b> have large, paddle-like paws to propel them through the water, and they've been documented swimming for hours. <b>Walruses</b> have large tusks that they use to pull themselves out of the water, and they find much of their food by foraging along the sea floor.

                    <h5 class="card-title text-center fs-3"> Arctic has abundant natural resources</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em> has many natural resources, including minerals, that can be highly profitable to humankind. It is said to have vast reserves of <b>natural gas and oil, iron ore, nickel, copper, zinc phosphates, precious metals, gemstones and diamonds</b>. While these are abundant, there is a need for expanding operations to increase production.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      It is also rich in fisheries, and since <b>2011</b> about eight metric tons have been harvested in <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em> waters.
                      <br>
                      Rock, stone, sand and gravel are mined in the <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em> region for offshore construction projects. With increasing development in the region, the procurement of these materials is also estimated to increase.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Interestingly, a political dead zone near the Arctic <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic Seas's</em> centre is related to a dispute among some countries in the region. This is because it might have <b>25%</b> or more of the undiscovered oil and <b>natural gas</b>.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Most of the known resources are located within the boundaries of <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em> nation states, making their ownership and rights to any exploitation politically uncontroversial and beyond challenge. The land masses are pretty much clearly defined among the <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic Eight</em> and their exclusive economic zones.

                    </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic Ocean</em> may be the world's smallest, but it's becoming a critical region as climate change warms it more quickly than anywhere else on <b>Earth</b>.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic Ocean</em> is experiencing some of the world's most drastic warming from climate change. In recent years, scientists have measured dwindling ice cover as record high temperatures inch up and up. One <b>2016</b> study predicted that ships would be able to sail through open water to <u>the North Pole</u> by <b>2040</b>.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                      The loss of sea ice will affect more than just the <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em>, scientists warn; it could change weather patterns around the world. Some have even predicted it could lead to colder, more extreme winters. A jet stream called the polar vortex encircles the <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em>, propelled forward by the difference between cold temperatures to the <b>north</b> and warm temperatures to the <b>south</b>. As the <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em> warms, scientists say the polar vortex will become more unstable and likely to send Arctic air <b>south</b>.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      In <b>2018</b>, the <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic Ocean</em> experienced its second-worst sea ice decline on record. Parts of <em style="color: blue;">Greenland</em>  were exposed to open ocean for the first time in millennia.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                      Scientists predict that warming waters could hurt wildlife. Terrestrial animals like <b>polar bears</b> rely on sea ice to traverse the landscape in search of food and to hunt, particularly <b>seals</b>. Warming will likely impact zooplankton life cycles, and thus the myriad animals that prey on them.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em> region has a fragile ecosystem impacted by <b>global warming</b>. The <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em> has <b>walruses</b> and four species of <b>whales</b>, including <b>the grey whale, beluga, bowhead whale and narwhal</b>. Also, six species of <b>seals</b>, including <b>the ribbon seal, ringed seal, harp seal, hooded seal and bearded seal</b>, are found in the waters of the <em style="color: blue;"> Arctic</em>.
