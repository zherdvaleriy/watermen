      <p class="px-3 fs-4 pb-3 ">Sharks bite roughly <b>70</b> people each year worldwide, with perhaps <b>5-10</b>  fatalities, according to data compiled in the <em style="color:
      blue"> International Shark Attack File (ISAF)</em>. Although shark bites get a lot of attention, this is far less than the number of people injured each year by elephants, bees, crocodiles, lightning or many other natural dangers. On the other side of the ledger, we kill somewhere between <b>20-100</b> million sharks every year through fishing activities.</p>

      <p class="px-3 fs-4 pb-5">Of the more than <b>500</b> or so shark species, about <b>80%</b> grow to less than <b>1.6 m</b> and are unable to hurt people or rarely encounter people. Only <b>32</b> species have been documented in biting humans, and an additional <b>36</b> species are considered potentially dangerous.
        <br>
        <br>

        Almost any shark 1.8 m or longer is a potential danger, but <b>three species have been identified repeatedly in fatal bites:</b> <u>great whites, tigers, and bull sharks</u>  All three are found worldwide, reach large sizes and eat large prey such as marine mammals or sea turtles. More bites on swimmers, free divers, scuba divers, surfers and boats have been reported for the great white shark than for any other species. However, some <b>80%</b> of all shark bites probably occur in the tropics and subtropics, where other shark species dominate and great white sharks are relatively rare.</p>

      <p class="px-3 fs-4 pb-5"><b>90%</b> of all volcanic activity occurs in the oceans.

        The speed of sound in water is <b>1,435 m/sec</b> – nearly five times faster than the speed of sound in air.
        
        The highest tides in the world are at the <em style="color: blue;">Bay of Fundy</em>, which separates <em style="color: blue;">New Brunswick from Nova Scotia</em>. At some times of the year the difference between high and low tide is <b>16.3 m</b>, taller than a three-story building.
        <br>
        <br>
        Earth’s longest mountain range is the <em style="color: blue;">Mid-Ocean Ridg</em> e more than <b>50,000 km</b> in length, which winds around the globe from the <a target="_blank" class="paragraph" href="/src/arctic.html">Arctic Ocean</a> to <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="#">the Atlantic</a>, skirting <u>Africa</u>, <u>Asia and Australia</u>, and crossing the <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="#">Pacific</a> to the west coast of <u>North America</u>. It is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies, and <em style="color: blue;">Himalayas</em> combined.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        The pressure at the deepest point in the ocean is more than <b> 11,318 tons/sq m</b>, or the equivalent of one person trying to support <b>50</b> jumbo jets.

        The top ten feet of the ocean holds as much heat as the entire atmosphere.

        The lowest known point on Earth, called the <em style="color: blue;">Challenger Deep</em>, is <b>11,034 m</b> deep, in the <em style="color: blue;">Marianas Trench</em> in the western <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="#">Pacific</a>. To get an idea of how deep that is, if you could take Mt. Everest and place it at the bottom of the trench there would still be over a mile of ocean above it. The Dead Sea is the Earth’s lowest land point with an elevation of <b>396 m</b> below sea level.</p>

        <p class="fs-3">Covering over two-thirds of our blue planet, the ocean makes it habitable. It is at the origin of all life on <em style="color: blue;">Earth</em> and affects each of our lives: it is the source of our freshwater and of half the oxygen we breathe; it also influences our climate and weather. Our ocean provides food, medicine, and mineral and energy resources. It supports a multitude of life forms and shapes the <em style="color: blue;">Earth’s</em> characteristics.
           <br>
           <br>
          The Intergovernmental <b>Oceanographic Commission</b> of <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://www.unesco.org/en">UNESCO</a> <u>(IOC-UNESCO)</u> is working to improve responses to the unprecedented environmental changes and human impacts now occurring and to promote ocean health via marine sciences. Much regard is given to <b>Africa</b> as well as Small Island Developing States where livelihoods depend heavily on marine resources.
           <br>
           <br>
          Marine ecosystem-based management requires a new generation of spatial planning tools to empower marine managers to implement best policies. <u>IOC-UNESCO</u> promotes <b>Marine Spatial Planning</b>, a practical way to create and establish a more rational organization of the use of marine space and the interactions between its uses, to balance demands for development with the need to protect marine ecosystems, and to achieve social and economic objectives in an open and planned way. <em style="color: blue;">The Integrated Coastal Area Management</em> (ICAM) programme is designed to assist countries in their efforts to build marine scientific and technological capabilities.
          <br>
          <br>
          <em style="color: blue;">The Ocean Biogeographic Information System</em> (OBIS) coordinates and manages the global marine biodiversity knowledge base.  The information portal holds data from bacteria to whales, from the equator to the poles and from the surface to the deepest ocean trenches. It is used around the globe for planning ocean conservation policies, and identifying biodiversity hotspots and global trends in species distribution.
          <br>
          <br>
          <u>IOC-UNESCO</u> supports the <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://www.un.org/regularprocess/woa2launch">UN World Ocean Assessment</a>, which is the regular process of reviewing the state of the marine environment, including socio-economic aspects. Keeping the world’s ocean and seas under continuing review by integrating existing information from different disciplines will help to improve the responses from national governments and the international community to the unprecedented environmental changes now occurring.
          <br>
          <br>
         <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://uk-ioc.org/IODE"> The International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange programme</a> (IODE)(link is external) enhances marine research and management by facilitating the exploitation, development, and exchange of data and information among Member States. The <u>IODE</u> works to narrow the “digital divide” by training marine information specialists and improving data system capacity in developing states, with an emphasis on <b>Africa</b>.  The <u>IOC</u> manages the <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://www.goosocean.org/">Global Ocean Observing System</a> (GOOS)(link is external) to provide a coordinated approach for monitoring and observing the global ocean, which requires an international effort and broad cooperation.
          <br>
          <br>
          The ocean surface currently absorbs almost one-third of the <b>CO2</b> that is emitted to the atmosphere from human activities, including fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and cement production.  Our science programmes support many studies of the impacts of climate change, including the <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://www.ioccp.org/">International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project</a> (IOCCP), <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://www.wcrp-climate.org/">the World Climate Research Programme</a> (WCRP)(link is external), and <a class="paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://gcos.wmo.int/en/ocean-observations-physics-and-climate-panel">the Ocean Observations Panel for Climate</a> (OOPC).</p>
