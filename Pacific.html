                            <em style="color: blue;">The Pacific Ocean</em> is the largest and deepest of Earth's four oceanic divisions.It extends from the <em style="color: blue;">Arctic Ocean</em>in the north to the<em style="color: blue;">Southern Ocean</em>,and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Oceania in the west and the Americas in the east. When the explorer Ferdinand Magellan visited Earth's biggest ocean in 1520, he found the waters pleasantly calm. And that's why — to this day — most people call it the Pacific Ocean, as "pacific" is a synonym for "peaceful."
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Magellan didn't know it, but there's a vast loop of volcanoes, trenches and seismically active places running through and around the Pacific. This would be the (in)famous "Ring of Fire." About 24,900 miles (40,000 kilometers) long, it's where most of the world's earthquakes and volcanic events take place.At 165,250,000 square kilometers in area (as defined with a southern Antarctic border), this largest division of the World Ocean and the hydrosphere covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of its total surface area, larger than Earth's entire land area combined.

                              The centers of both the Water Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, as well as the oceanic pole of inaccessibility are in the Pacific Ocean.

The World Bank's Pacific Island member countries have a combined population of about <b>2.3 million people</b> across a unique and diverse region <em style="color: blue;"> the Pacific Rim</em>, The region is made up of hundreds of islands scattered over an area equivalent to 15% of the earth's surface.

                             <br>

                            <em style="color: blue;">The Pacific Ocean</em> stirs up some of the strongest hurricanes ever seen. For example, in 2018 the strongest storm of the year was <em style="color: blue;"> Super Typhoon Mangkhut</em> It hit the Philippines in late September before dissipating over mainland China. At its strongest, the storm’s winds topped 165 miles per hour, uprooting trees, destroying homes, and causing deadly mudslides.

                            <em style="color: blue;"> The Pacific basin</em> is called the “Ring of Fire” because of the area of earthquake and volcanic activity around its edges. The resulting chain of volcanoes is roughly 25,000 miles long and springs to life where the Pacific tectonic plate slides against or collides into the other tectonic plates that circle it

                            The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the construction industry.
                            <br>
                            Salt, bromine, and magnesium have been mined. Underwater exploration for oil has occurred off the coasts of Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, California, Russia, and China.

                            <br>
                            As the ice caps melt, and the sea temperatures increase, the oceans expand, and sea levels rise. Sea level rise will affect coastal communities, particularly in many low-lying islands found in the Pacific, as well as affecting the level of freshwater available on those islands.

                             <br>
                             Because of geography and sometimes-limited resources,<em style="color: blue;">Pacific island</em>  nations are already especially vulnerable to these disasters. We've already established that, on average, sea surface temperatures are climbing across the globe. And as sea surface temperatures become warmer, hurricanes can become more powerful

                             <br>
                             The effects of ocean warming include sea level rise due to thermal expansion, coral bleaching, accelerated melting of Earth's major ice sheets, intensified hurricanes*, and changes in ocean health and biochemistry.

                            Pacific habitats and species face threats from proposed deep-sea mining , coastal development, nutrient loading, sedimentation, disease, invasive species, predator outbreaks, overfishing, destructive fishing, marine noise and light pollution, ocean acidification, and climate change with the impacts of higher temperatures, sea level rise, and increased risk of storm damage.
